# Virtual Card Manager

**The 'Cards' tab allows you to manage your virtual storage cards.**


## Background
 Many Palm OS devices featured SD card expansion ports. Adding an SD card could be used for many purposes, such as storing addition programs, or storing large files or databases or multimedia. Some software was even distributed on SD cards.

CloudPilot allows you to connect virtual storage cards to your emulated device.

## Managing Cards
### Adding a card
 Tap the plus button in the top right corner to add a card. You can either create a blank card, or you can import an existing image file into CloudPilot.
 
 **Importing a card**: Imported cards should be provided in a binary .img file format. 
 
 **Creating a blank card**: If you choose to create a card, you will be asked to configure the size of the virtual card. *Note: the size of the card currently cannot be changed after creation.*

### Exporting a card
If you wish to export an image of a current card in CloudPilot, right click on the card in the list, and choose 'Save'. An image of the card will then download.

### Deleting a card
To delete a card, right click on the card in the list, and choose 'Delete'.

### Renaming a card
To rename a card, right click on the card in the list, and then choose 'Edit'.

### Checking card filesystem
To verify a card is not corrupted, right click on the card in the list, and choose 'Check'.

## Mounting & Ejecting Cards
*Note: It is recommended to return to the Palm OS program launcher (home screen) before inserting or removing cards.*

To 'insert' or 'mount' a card in a device, go to the 'Emulator' tab, open the contextual menu (three dots), and tap 'Insert SD Card'. The card will then be mounted in the simulated device. 

To eject a currently mounted card, choose 'Eject SD card'. 

**Please Note: To avoid data corruption, do not eject a card during file operations.**

## Browsing a card
To browse the contents of a virtual card, tap on the card in the list. See the help menu within the file explorer for more detailed information. 

*Note: If the card is currently 'inserted' or 'mounted' in a virtual device, you will be prompted to eject this card before it can be browsed.*
