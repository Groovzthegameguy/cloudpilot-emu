# Virtual Card File Explorer

**The card file explorer allows you to manage the contents of your virtual storage cards.**

## Information about Palm OS and file locations
Palm OS was extended in version 4.0 with support for expansion cards. when a card is inserted, a new 'category' will appear on the Palm OS launcher (home screen) with the name of the card.

Palm OS looks for files in very specific locations:
* /Palm/Launcher -- any PRC or PDB files that are placed in this location will appear in the Palm OS launcher when the card category is selected.
* /Palm/Programs -- most programs that enable users to store data on an expansion card will create their own folder in this location.
* /DCIM/ -- this is the location where digital camera images are typically saved to, and as a result, most image browser programs will look in this location for photos and media.


## Uploading Files
To upload a file into the card there are two options:
* First bring up the contextual menu (three dots), and choose 'Add file'. 
* Alternatively, you can also drag-and-drop individual files into the card window. 

**Please note**: folders are not able to be uploaded, it is recommended to instead zip a folder, upload, and then unzip the folder within the virtual card.

## Working with Files
The contextual menu provides a number of options for working with files on the virtual card. 

* To create a new folder, choose 'Add directory'.
* The contextual menu also allows you to select multiple files, and to both create and unpack zip files.
* To download a specific file from the virtual card to your host machine:
    * On desktop: Right click on the file in the file explorer, and choose 'save'.
    * On mobile: Swipe from right to left on the file, and choose the cyan 'share' button.
* To delete, cut, copy and paste files:
    * On desktop: right click on a file, and choose the appropriate option.
    * On mobile: swipe from right to left on the file to reveal the copy/paste and delete buttons.
* Likewise, to rename a file, right click on the file, and choose 'edit'.

## File Attributes

Every file and folder on a virtual card has three file attributes:

* Read-only Flag
* Hidden Flag
* System Flag

These attributes can be viewed in the main file list as icons on the right side of the file listing panel. 

To modify these attributes, bring up the file edit panel:

 * On desktop: Right click on the file in the file explorer, and choose 'edit'.
 * On mobile: Swipe from right to left on the file, and choose the blue 'edit' button.
