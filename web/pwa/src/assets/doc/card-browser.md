# Virtual Card File Explorer

**The card file explorer allows you to manage the content of your virtual storage cards.**

## Information about Palm OS and file locations
Palm OS was extended in version 4.0 with support for expansion cards. when a card is inserted, a new 'category' will appear on the Palm OS launcher (home screen) with the name of the card.

Palm OS looks for files in very specific locations:
* /Palm/Launcher -- any PRC or PDB files that are placed in this location will appear in the Palm OS launcher when the card category is selected.
* /Palm/Programs -- most programs that enable users to store data on an expansion card will create their own folder in this location.
* /DCIM/ -- this is the location where digital camera images are typically saved to, and as a result, most image browser programs will look in this location for photos and media.
